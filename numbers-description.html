This is a collection of flashcard decks I generated so that I could study the periodic table. I wrote it for use with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" rel="nofollow">Anki</a>, but csv files are available for other flashcard applications, just as long as those applications support html and use the same syntax for cloze completions.

I've had great luck going through these decks. I've gone through them several times now in Anki, all but a few cards have review intervals on the order of months, and now I think it's ready to share with others.

This deck accompanies the one <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/922797769">here</a> and teaches atomic numbers. It chiefly represents two functions:

<ul>
<li>given an atomic number, produce the corresponding element</li>
<li>given an element, produce its atomic number</li>
</ul>

The cards in this deck look something like this:

In Night mode, they look something like this:

I recommend studying this at the same time you're going through the "Groups and Periods" deck, and tweak the "New cards/day" setting for these decks to be half that of the "Groups and Periods" deck. This way their content will keep sync as long as you do all of them each day.
